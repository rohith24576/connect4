                    HOW TO WIN AGAINST THE CPU - PRACTICAL TRICKS
================================================================================
You play as RED (first move). CPU plays as YELLOW (second move).
Board: 7 columns (0-6), 6 rows. Column 3 is the center. Pieces drop from top.
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RULE 1: ALWAYS START WITH COLUMN 3 (CENTER)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Connect4 is solved: the first player wins with perfect play. Column 3 is the
only winning first move. Never open with 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 - you give away
the advantage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RULE 2: BUILD TWO THREATS THAT NEED DIFFERENT BLOCKS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A "fork" = two 3-in-a-rows that need different columns to block. CPU can only
block one. Your two threats must NOT share the same blocking column.

Example of a fork:
  - Threat A: R-R-R in cols 1-2-3, need one more in col 2 (above)
  - Threat B: R-R-R in cols 3-4-5, need one more in col 4 (above)
  - CPU blocks col 2 -> you play col 4 and win
  - CPU blocks col 4 -> you play col 2 and win

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EASY MODE - EXACT WINNING SEQUENCES (copy these moves)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SEQUENCE A - Classic center fork (works when CPU stacks center):
  You: 3   CPU: 3   You: 2   CPU: 2   You: 4   CPU: 4   You: 1
  After move 6, you have R-R-R in cols 1-2-3 and R-R-R in cols 3-4-5.
  CPU blocks one; you play the other and win.

SEQUENCE B - If CPU plays column 2 after your R3:
  You: 3   CPU: 2   You: 4   CPU: 3   You: 5   CPU: 4   You: 6
  Build on the right. You get a horizontal or diagonal fork.

SEQUENCE C - If CPU plays column 4 after your R3:
  You: 3   CPU: 4   You: 2   CPU: 3   You: 1   CPU: 2   You: 0
  Build on the left. Mirror of Sequence B.

SEQUENCE D - Vertical stack trap (edge column):
  You: 0   CPU: 3   You: 0   CPU: 3   You: 0   CPU: (any)   You: 0
  Three in column 0. If CPU ignores, you win in col 0. If CPU blocks col 0,
  you now have a stack - play col 1 or 6 to start a diagonal from that stack.

SEQUENCE E - Diagonal trap:
  You: 3   CPU: 2   You: 4   CPU: 3   You: 5   CPU: 4   You: 5
  Build diagonal: pieces at (5,3), (4,4), (3,5). Play col 5 again - piece
  drops to row 2. Now you have diagonal R-R-R-R. Win.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MODERATE MODE - THE AI IS STRONG (depth 10, PVS)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moderate uses Iterative Deepening + Principal Variation Search to depth 10.
It sees 10 half-moves ahead. Beating it requires near-perfect play.

TRICK 1: USE THE SOLVED OPENING
  Move 1: Column 3 (mandatory)
  Move 2: If CPU plays 3, play 2 or 4. If CPU plays 2, play 4. If CPU plays 4, play 2.
  Move 3: Build toward a fork. Prefer columns 2, 3, 4 early - control the center.

TRICK 2: FORCE THE CPU TO BLOCK IN A BAD SPOT
  Create a threat where the only block leaves the CPU's piece in a position
  that helps your next threat. Example: vertical R-R-R in col 2. CPU must
  block col 2. Their piece lands at bottom. You play col 3 - now you have
  a diagonal starting from that bottom piece. The block helped you.

TRICK 3: AVOID OBVIOUS TRAPS
  The AI checks for double threats and forks. Do not set up a fork that
  takes 2 moves to complete - the AI will see it. Instead, set up a fork
  that completes in 1 move (two 3-in-a-rows that both need one more in
  different columns). The AI cannot block both.

TRICK 4: PLAY THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF CPU'S STACK
  If CPU stacks column 3, build on 2 and 4. If CPU stacks 2, build on 3 and 4.
  You want options on both sides so the CPU cannot block everything.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HARD MODE - THE AI IS VERY STRONG (DP + memoization)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hard uses transposition table - it remembers positions and searches efficiently.
Depth 6 with memoization. Very difficult to beat.

TRICK 1: PERFECT OPENING ONLY
  You must play the solved opening. Any mistake in the first 4 moves and
  the CPU will outplay you. R3, then R2 or R4 depending on CPU. Never
  play edge columns (0, 6) early unless following a specific trap.

TRICK 2: PATIENCE
  Do not rush. Build solidly. One weak move and the CPU will punish.
  Prefer moves that both attack and defend.

TRICK 3: IF YOU FALL BEHIND
  The CPU will not make obvious mistakes. If you are losing, try to
  force a draw by blocking all of CPU's winning paths. A draw is
  better than a loss.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UNIVERSAL TRICKS (ALL DIFFICULTIES)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. CENTER CONTROL
   Columns 2, 3, 4 are strongest. Fight for them. If CPU has center,
   attack from both sides (cols 1 and 5, or 0 and 6).

2. BLOCK AND BUILD
   When you must block CPU's threat, try to block in a column that
   also extends your own 2-in-a-row. One move, two purposes.

3. BOTTOM ROW FIRST
   Pieces at the bottom support everything above. Prefer building
   from the bottom. A piece at row 2 with empty rows below is weak.

4. DIAGONALS WIN GAMES
   Horizontal and vertical are obvious. Diagonals are harder to see
   and block. Build diagonals: (5,2)-(4,3)-(3,4)-(2,5) or similar.

5. THE FORCED BLOCK
   Create a threat. CPU blocks. Use that block to start your next
   threat. The CPU's "block" becomes part of your winning line.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUICK REFERENCE - FIRST 4 MOVES (YOU ARE RED)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Move 1: 3 (always)
Move 2: If Y3 -> play 2. If Y2 -> play 4. If Y4 -> play 2. If Y1/Y5 -> play 3.
Move 3: Build toward fork. Usually 4 (if you played 2) or 2 (if you played 4).
Move 4: Create second threat or block CPU. Aim for two 3-in-a-rows.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HONEST ASSESSMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EASY:    Follow the exact sequences. Double threats work. You should win.
MODERATE: Hard. AI sees 10 moves ahead. Use perfect opening; hope AI slips.
HARD:    Very hard. Near-perfect play needed. Draw is a good result.
